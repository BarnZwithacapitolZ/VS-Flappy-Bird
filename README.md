# VS-Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird in Visual Studio!

I got bored in College so made a Flappy Bird clone in one of my lessons. This was initially a platformer, however I changed the code into Flappy Bird as platformers are boring.

The absence of Classes makes the code hard to build upon and inefficient. The pipe generation algorithm turned out pretty good tho!

I added the bin/debug folder so you can run the executable through there, if you dont wont to load vs.
